					The King Ludwig Oak (in German: König-Ludwig-Eiche, and also Königseiche, Tausendjährige Eiche, and until the middle of the 19th century Stolze Eiche) is an oak tree [2] recognised as a natural monument in the Staatsbad Brückenau, a
					state-run spa and park two kilometers (1.2 mi) west of Bad Brückenau in the German state of Bavaria. The German Tree Archive counts the oak among the trees of national importance (National bedeutsamer Baum, NBB).[3]
					Estimates of its age range between 370 and 700 years. The circumference of the trunk is about seven meters (23 ft). It is named after King Ludwig I, who frequented it during his numerous spa stays at the Staatsbad Brückenau. The oak has
					been described and depicted many times since 1780. Numerous domestic aristocrats and monarchs from abroad who were staying in Brückenau for the cure visited the oak.

							The idea of a legal right to truth is distinct from the pre-existing understanding of the importance of establishing the truth about what happened in a case of human rights violation.[3] In 1977, Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions
							enshrined a right for families of people killed in armed conflicts to find out what happened to their relatives.[9] A 1993 conference at the Catholic Institute for International Relations addressed the right to truth.[10] The right to
							truth has been recognized in international soft law instruments such as the United Nations Principles to Combat Impunity (2005)[11][12] and UN General Assembly Resolution 60/147, as well as by the 2011 appointment of a United Nations
							Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of non-Recurrence.[11] In 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Commission determined that there was an "inalienable and autonomous right" to truth. The
							International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance also guarantees victims of forced disappearance a right to know the circumstances of the disappearance, but it is not universally ratified.[13]

							According to Patricia Naftali, the right to truth remains elusive because it is a concept with different definitions (sometimes contradictory), which is deployed in support of a variety of human rights claims.[14][15]

				As meat is typically expensive, we could expect an association between the wealth of a country and its meat consumption.
				All countries in Europe do not have the same quality of life, and life quality may also influence meat consumption.
				We use GDP per capita to measure country wealth, and our data is from the <a style="color: #06547A;" href="https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm">OECD</a>.
				Let us first plot the GDP per capita over the last ten years. <br />

						We can see that Western Europe and northern countries have a high gdp per capita, and eastern countries lower.
						We can also note that GDP per capita has been growing for all countries.<br /><br /> Do we also see an increase in meat consumption ?<br />
						Let's plot the meat consumption per gdp per capita, for all countries and all dates from 2004 to 2013. <br />

						From the degree 1 regression line, we could roughly expect an increase of 0.004 of meat consumption per increase of GDP per capita.<br /><br />
						This picture is however not quite right; we now plot the result also by year, and additionally group countries by <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">clustering</span> using k-means, with 3 clusters. <br />

				<div class="content" style="margin-top: 50px;width:80%;margin-left:10%;text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">
					<p>
						We can first note that the clustering is meaningful: the first group corresponds roughly to poorer countries (mostly eastern), the second group to richer EU countries, and the third to Luxembourg.
						These groupings are also stable through time, with essentially only Spain and Greece moving from group 2 to group 1, which makes sense as these two countries have been particularly hit by the <span class="meatTitle"
							style="color: #06547A;">2008 economic crisis</span>.
						<br /><br />The poorer group consumes on average less meat than the richer countries, <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">69.69 vs 86.31 kg per capita</span> in 2004.
						We can also see that poorer countries show a stronger variation, with 50 for Bulgaria and 90 for Hungary, whereas richer countries are more similar.
						Within these groups, however, consumption does not increase much with time: the average for poor countries is 70.834 in 2013 and 86.97 for richer countries in 2013.
						This is despite the average GDP per capita increasing by almost <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">75%</span> for poor countries and <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">39%</span> for richer countries.
						<br />How can we explain this result, seemingly paradoxical compared to the previous correlation ? <br /><br />

						We note that countries that have been rich for longer eat more meat; but countries do not change their meat consumption by much, even as their income can grow quite fast.
						This can mean that wealth impacts meat consumption in the long term but not in the short term, which can depend more on non-economic factors such as <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">cultural habits</span>.
						Can a short term change in economic situation still impact meat consumption ? Let us retake our first average meat consumption graph.
						We can see that average consumption increased until 2007, then decreased; this period corresponds to the economic crisis in Europe. The change in consumption is however not very large.
						Our conclusion is that changes in wealth has a <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">small impact in the short term</span>, but <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">potentially significant in the long term</span>,
						with more wealth leading to higher meat consumption.

				Meat consumption is an important consideration to tackle climate change.
				We have looked into meat consumption in Europe and France, and its association with different factors that could impact consumption. We have made the following observations: <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- We have seen that wealth and economic considerations play a role in determining people's consumption, but mostly in the <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">long term</span>, and that a fast change in wealth
				does not quickly affect meat consumption. <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- We have seen that in France, the drop in meat consumption in 2008 is more likely related to the <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">economic situation</span> than to the price of meat. <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- That in France at least, meat consumption does not seem to be related to interest in <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">climate change.</span> <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- That people's interest in climate change is fairly related to news coverage. <br />
