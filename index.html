						The King Ludwig Oak (in German: König-Ludwig-Eiche, and also Königseiche, Tausendjährige Eiche, and until the middle of the 19th century Stolze Eiche) is an oak tree [2] recognised as a natural monument in the Staatsbad Brückenau, a
						state-run spa and park two kilometers (1.2 mi) west of Bad Brückenau in the German state of Bavaria. The German Tree Archive counts the oak among the trees of national importance (National bedeutsamer Baum, NBB).[3]
						Estimates of its age range between 370 and 700 years. The circumference of the trunk is about seven meters (23 ft). It is named after King Ludwig I, who frequented it during his numerous spa stays at the Staatsbad Brückenau. The oak has
						been described and depicted many times since 1780. Numerous domestic aristocrats and monarchs from abroad who were staying in Brückenau for the cure visited the oak.

			<p style="width:70%;margin-left:15%;text-align:justify;text-align-last:left;">
				To assess if men and women are treated equally, we matched them in pairs and compared the
				decision taken by the police officer. The matching allows to pair one male driver with one female
				driver presenting a similar subjective signal to the police officer. Men-Women pairs have the same race to
				avoid a potential racial bias. They belong to the same age category (more or less than 45 years old).
				The age is used as a proxy for the attractiveness of the drivers.
			</p>
			<p style="width:70%;margin-left:15%;text-align:justify;text-align-last:left;">

				When analyzing the search decision, the pairs have also the same reason for search which allows
				to compare drivers offering to the officer a similar suspicion level to find contraband.
			</p>


			<p style="width:70%;margin-left:15%;text-align:justify;text-align-last:left;">
				When analyzing the stop outcome decision, the pairs have also the same reason for stop
				and the same search issue (contraband found or not). This allow to compare drivers having
				committed the same infractions.

			</p>

			<p style="width:70%;margin-left:15%;text-align:justify;text-align-last:left;">
				The results are displayed on the maps bellow.

					<p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">
						When a police officer is suspecting the driver to be carrying contraband,
						he can search him/her and his/her car. While looking for drugs or guns it would be
						surprising to search the person but not the car. These cases could be instances
						of unwarranted person searches and sexual assault.

						The figure bellow compares the AOD in the search decision of stops where
						the car has been searched to stops where it wasn’t. We observe AODs of 0 for
						some police departments. These cases are specific to the dataset. The search
						reason feature refers also to the person search meaning that by matching pairs
						on the search reason we have only drivers that have been searched when their car
						wasn’t. For the datasets of Charlotte and Greensboro, we observe lower AOD for
						cases where the car was searched than where it wasn’t. The difference between
						men and women is then smaller.

				Let's dig into even more details concerning stop decisions. What happens if we split female from male officers, and look for the average outcome difference ? The aim of this analysis is to find out if the officer's gender has an impact on a
				potential bias in decision making. For this purpose, a similar methodology is applied as before to balance our dataset, and outcome difference for each type of potential violation will be compared. Very few datasets contain all information
				needed
				for this analysis, hence it is performed only on the big dataset of Florida state (3.2 Mio stop records for men officers, 0.25 Mio for women officers before filtering).

							The AOD for the woman officers is near 0, and the confidence interval ranges from negative to positive values:<br /><br /> at this point, it is not possible to determine whether woman officers take biased decisions. However, it seems
							different for men : their average outcome when deciding on the outcome of a stop seems to indicate that they tend to search men more than woman drivers, even if the age range, race, subjective indicator (reason for stop) are identical

							From the results when splitting men from women officers, and splitting the group by type of reason, some interesting findings appear :<br /><br />
							- Men officers are more gentle with female drivers, reprehending them less than male drivers, whereas women officers do not make a significant difference between them. The exact inverse conclusion can be drawn for the seatbelt
							violation.<br /><br />
							- Both men and women officers seem more gentle with female drivers that have faulty equipment, as well as other types of TAG or registration violations.<br /><br />
							- Men officers seem particularly biased regarding "Other type of moving violation" : hence men officers decide themselves for harder outcomes when facing a male driver. This is however not the case for female officers, acting equally on
							male and female drivers for this violation type.<br /><br />
							- Female officers seem particularly biased with female for traffic control device violation : they tend to let them get away more easily than men drivers.

				Meat consumption is an important consideration to tackle climate change.
				We have looked into meat consumption in Europe and France, and its association with different factors that could impact consumption. We have made the following observations: <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- We have seen that wealth and economic considerations play a role in determining people's consumption, but mostly in the <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">long term</span>, and that a fast change in wealth
				does not quickly affect meat consumption. <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- We have seen that in France, the drop in meat consumption in 2008 is more likely related to the <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">economic situation</span> than to the price of meat. <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- That in France at least, meat consumption does not seem to be related to interest in <span class="meatTitle" style="color: #06547A;">climate change.</span> <br /><br />
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- That people's interest in climate change is fairly related to news coverage. <br />
