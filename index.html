						Many researches already exist on disparities in US policing and this research extension, inspired by <a style="color: #478AEC;" href="https://5harad.com/papers/100M-stops.pdf">this paper</a>, modifies the focus to assess a potential bias
						due to the driver’s
						gender. Indeed, this factor is susceptible to
						influence the sensibility of the officer, which may act differently with men or women. Search decisions and stop outcome could therefore differ, which is evaluated in this study through a data analysis on several US states or cities
						provided in <a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/" style="color: #478AEC;">this database</a>. The aim is to determine if there are disparities in drivers' treatment and whether it is comparable across the USA. This is done by
						first balancing the
						datasets, and then comparing stop, search and hit rate
						statistically. Average outcome differences are then computed for datasets of states that present the required features, to quantify 1. the difference in searches effectively done (for same reason to search) and 2. the difference in stop
						outcomes for same stop reasons. This study ends with a study case on Florida, that permits to assess a potential effect of officer's gender.

				(to compare drivers offering to the officer a similar suspicion level to find contraband) and same search issue.

						if there is a reason for stop, some police department necessarily have either the

						or simply indicate no search even if there was a reason for that is written). The search
						reason feature refers also to the person search meaning that by matching pairs
						on the search reason, we have only drivers that have been searched when their car

				Let's dig into even more details concerning stop decisions. What happens if we split female from male officers, and look for the average outcome difference ? The aim of this analysis is to find out if the officer's gender has an impact on a
				potential bias in decision making. For this purpose, a similar methodology is applied as before to balance our dataset, and outcome difference for each type of potential violation will be compared. Very few datasets contain all information
				needed
				for this analysis, hence it is performed only on the big dataset of Florida state (3.2 Mio stop records for men officers, 0.25 Mio for women officers before filtering).

							- Women officers are more gentle with male drivers that drive at too high speed, reprehending them less than female drivers, whereas men officers do not make a significant difference between them. <br /><br />
							- For seatbelt violation, it is the exact opposite : women do not make any difference in their judgement, whereas men officers are more gentle with female drivers.
							- Both men and women officers seem significantly more gentle with female drivers that have faulty equipment.<br /><br />
							- Men officers seem particularly biased regarding registration and TAG violations, as well as traffic control devices violations : they decide themselves for harder outcomes when facing a male driver. This is however not the case for
							female officers, acting equally on
							male and female drivers for these violation types.<br /><br />
							- Female officers seem particularly biased with female for CMV inspections : they tend to let them get away less easily than men drivers.

				This analysis permits to show very interesting, statistically verified, findings : altough there is similar hit rates for men and women, US male and female drivers get treated differently by officers when stopped, independently from their
				ange range, gender, race and propensity to carry contraband. These differences may vary depending on the type of violation, and particularly whether the officer is a man or a woman. Tendancially, men officers show most bias, being more gentle
				to woman drivers than to men.
				It was shown that policers behave differently depending on they searched the car of the driver : if not, the difference in outcome is very often quite inexistant, showing a equivalent treatment for male and female drivers. However, a
				significant difference appears if the car's searched : men are more often searched than women.
				Across different states, these differences and conclusions may vary, and not precise pattern can be made explicit.
				Weaknesses are of course present in this study, particularly on the officers' sexual orientation (which is partly assessed in the case study), and some improvement could be achieved by
