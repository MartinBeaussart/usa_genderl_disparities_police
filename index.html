						Many researches already exist on disparities in US policing and this research extension, inspired by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0858-1">this article</a>, modifies the focus to assess a potential bias due to the driver’s gender. Indeed, this factor is susceptible to
						influence the sensibility of the officer, which may act differently with men or women. Search decisions and stop outcome could therefore differ. This is evaluated in this study through a data analysis on several US states or cities
						provided <a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/">here</a>. The aim is to determine if there are disparities in drivers' treatment and whether it is comparable across the USA. This is done by first balancing the datasets, and then comparing stop, search and hit rate
						statistically. Average outcome differences are then computed for datasets of states that present the required features, to quantify 1. the difference in searches effectively done (for same reason to search) and 2. the difference in stop
						outcomes for same stop reasons. This study ends with a study case on Florida, that permits to assess a potential effect of officer's gender.

				To assess if men and women are treated equally, they are paired and their outcome decision taken by the police officer

				driver presenting a similar subjective signal to the police officer : same race (to
				avoid a potential racial bias), same age category (more or less than 45 years old), same reason for search
				(to compare drivers offering to the officer a similar suspicion level to find contraband) and same search issue.
				The age is used as a proxy for the attractiveness of the drivers.

						When a police officer is suspecting the driver to be carrying contraband,

						The figure bellow compares the AOD in the search decision of stops where

						some police departments. These cases are specific to the dataset, as appearently,
						if there is a reason for stop, some police department necessarily have either the
						vehicle or the person searched (other state have also frisk that can be performed,
						or simply indicate no search even if there was a reason for that is written). The search
						reason feature refers also to the person search meaning that by matching pairs
						on the search reason, we have only drivers that have been searched when their car
						wasn’t. For the datasets of Charlotte and Greensboro, we observe lower AOD for

				Let's dig into even more details concerning stop decisions. What happens if we split female from male officers, and look for the average outcome difference ? The aim of this analysis is to find out if the officer's gender has an impact on a
				potential bias in decision making. For this purpose, a similar methodology is applied as before to balance our dataset, and outcome difference for each type of potential violation will be compared. Very few datasets contain all information
				needed
				for this analysis, hence it is performed only on the big dataset of Florida state (3.2 Mio stop records for men officers, 0.25 Mio for women officers before filtering).

							The AOD for the woman officers is near 0, and the confidence interval ranges from negative to positive values:<br /><br /> at this point, it is not possible to determine whether woman officers take biased decisions. However, it seems

							- For seatbelt violation, it is the exact opposite : women do not make any difference in their judgement, whereas men officers are more gentle with female drivers. <br /><br />
							- Both men and women officers seem significantly more gentle with female drivers that have faulty equipment.<br /><br />
							- Men officers seem particularly biased regarding registration and TAG violations, as well as traffic control devices violations : they decide themselves for harder outcomes when facing a male driver. This is however not the case for female officers, acting equally on
							male and female drivers for these violation types.<br /><br />
							- Female officers seem particularly biased with female for CMV inspections : they tend to let them get away less easily than men drivers.

			</header>
			<p style=" width:70%;margin-left:15%;text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;font-size: 1.2rem;">

				This analysis permits to show very interesting, statistically verified, findings : altough there is similar hit rates for men and women, US male and female drivers get treated differently by officers when stopped, independently from their
				age range, gender, race and propensity to carry contraband. These differences may vary depending on the type of violation, and particularly whether the officer is a man or a woman. Tendancially, men officers show most bias, being more gentle
				to woman drivers than to men.
				It was shown that policers behave differently depending on if they searched the car of the driver : if not, the difference in outcome is very often quite inexistant, showing an equivalent treatment for male and female drivers. However, a
				significant difference appears if the car's searched : men are more often searched than women.
				Across different states, these differences and conclusions may vary, and not precise pattern can be made explicit.
				Weaknesses are of course present in this study, particularly on the officers' sexual orientation (which is partly assessed in the case study). Further improvements could be achieved if the reasons for stop and search would be more precise and better
				documented. Police officers who are conducting gender profiling might also cover themselves by overstating reason for stop and search. This would bias the study. This issue should be adressed in further work.
